\value{
an object of class microout with the following components:

`Tz` Array of air temperatures at height `reqhgt` (deg C). Identical to `T0`
if `reqhgt` = 0.

`tleaf` Array of leaf temperatures at height `reqhgt` (deg C).
NA if `reqhgt` greater than canopy height or `reqhgt` <= 0.

`T0` Array of ground surface temperatures (deg C)

`relhum` Array of relative humidities at height `reqhgt` (percentage).
NA if `reqhgt` <= 0.

`windspeed` Array of wind speeds at height `reqhgt` (m/s).
NA if `reqhgt` <= 0.

`raddir` Array of direct shortwave radiation received on horizontal
surface (W/m^2). NA if `reqhgt` <= 0.

`raddif` Array of direct shortwave radiation received on horizontal
surface (W/m^2). NA if `reqhgt` <= 0.

`radlw` Array of downward longwave radiation received on horizontal
surface (W/m^2). NA if `reqhgt` <= 0.
}
\description{
The function `runmicro_hr` runs the microclimate model in hourly
time increments
}
\details{
`pai_a` is used to calaculate the radiation incercepted by leaves at `reqhgt` if
below canopy. If not supplied it is calaculated from total plant area index by
assuming leaf density within the canopy is uniformly vertically distributed. If suuplied
it must have the same dimensions as micro$pai. I.e. with the same x and y dims as the
the supplied dtm and values for each hour as the z dimension. The paramater `surfwet`
determines how much of the canopy should be treated as wet surface when calaculating
latent heat fluxes. However, except when extremely droughted, the matric potential of leaves
is such that `surfwet` ~ 1.
