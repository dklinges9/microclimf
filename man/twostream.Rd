\title{Applies two-stream radiation model}
\usage{
twostream(micro, reqhgt = 0.05, pai_a = NA, slr = NA, apr = NA, hor = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{micro}{an object of class `micro` as returned by [modelin()]}

\item{reqhgt}{height at which temperatures are required (m). Negative if below ground}

\item{pai_a}{plant area index above `reqhgt`. Determined from total `pai` if not supplied}

\item{slr}{an optional SpatRaster object of slope values (Radians). Calculated from
dtm if not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}

\item{apr}{an optional SpatRaster object of aspect values (Radians). Calculated from
dtm if not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}

\item{hor}{an optional array of the tangent of the angle to the horizon in
24 directions. Calculated from dtm if not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}
}
\value{
an object of class micro with additional terms added for subsequent modelling
}
\description{
The function `twostream` applies a varient of the Sellers two-stream
radiation model to calaculate long and showtwave radiation absorbed by the ground and
canopy and shortwave radiation absorbed by leafs.
