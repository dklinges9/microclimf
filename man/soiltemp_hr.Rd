24 directions. Calculated from dtm if not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}

\item{wsa}{an optional array of wind shelter coefficients in 8 directions.
Calculated from dtm if not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}

\item{maxhgt}{an optional height (m) for which wind speed is needed. Determined
from height of tallest vegetation or as 2 m, whichever is greater, if not supplied.}

\value{
an object of class micro with the following components added:

`T0` ground surface temperature (deg C)

`theta` surface soil moisture fraction

additional terms needed for subsequent modelling.

The function `soiltemp_hr` estimates ground surface temperature
}
\details{
if [groundrad()] has not been run to add additional elements to `micro`
it is automatically called.
