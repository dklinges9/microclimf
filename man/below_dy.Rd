\arguments{
\item{microd}{object of class microin as returned by [modelin()]}

\item{reqhgt}{height above ground at which model outputs are needed (m). Must be negative.}

\item{expand}{optional logical indicating whethet to expand daily values to hourly}

\item{xyf}{optional input for called function [wind()]}

\item{zf}{optional input for called function [wind()]}

\item{soilinit}{initial soil moisture fractions in surface and subsurface layer (see [soilmpredict()])}

\item{tfact}{coefficient determining sensitivity of soil moisture to variation
in topographic wetness (see [soilmdistribute()])}

\item{slr}{an optional RasterLayer of slope values (Radians). Calculated from
dtm if not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}

\item{apr}{an optional RasterLayer of aspect values (Radians). Calculated from
dtm if not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}

\item{hor}{an optional array of the tangent of the angle to the horizon in
24 directions. Calculated from dtm if not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}

\item{wsa}{an optional array of wind shelter coefficients in 8 directions.
Calculated from dtm if not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}

\item{maxhgt}{an optional height (m) for which wind speed is needed. Determined
from height of tallest vegetation or as 2 m, whichever is greater, if not supplied.}

\item{twi}{optional raster of topographic wetness index values.
Calculated from `dtm` of not supplied, but outer cells will be NA.}
